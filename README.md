This repository contains common test vectors for Eth2.0 implementations. The tests are YAML files following the [general testing format](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/test-format.md). Each set of tests is located in its own directory at the root of the repository.

The generators that are responsible for most of the tests can be found in [ethereum/eth2.0-test-generators](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-test-generators).

To add or update handwritten tests, please open a pull request here. For automatically generated tests, please follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-test-generators).
